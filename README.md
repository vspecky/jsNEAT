# jsNEAT (Version Alpha)
My JavaScript implementation of the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) Genetic Algorithm.  
I'm referring to the original paper by Kenneth O. Stanley et al (2002) for the implementation. You can find it [here](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).  
The vanilla implementation is finished and the algorithm will be fully usable once I finish debugging and testing. Following is a TODO list :-  
- Add JSDocs to all class methods.  
- Add helpful comments everywhere to help anyone going through the code understand what's going on. For theoretical understanding, please refer to the original paper at the link above.  
- Create a separate jsNEAT-examples repository so people can see the algorithm in action and also implemented in code without going through the docs.  
- Write a docs page.
