# jsNEAT (Work in Progress)
My JavaScript implementation of the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) Genetic Algorithm.  
I'm referring to the original paper by Kenneth O. Stanley et al (2002) for the implementation. You can find it [here](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).
